# MCP servers

A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server adds its tools to the agent. A server is
an ability: an `mcp.toml` in its folder under `marketplace/abilities/`, synced from the marketplace or written
by you. It works in the cloud too when it's remote, or a stdio one the MCP sandbox runs.

A server connects when a [persona](/abilities/personas#abilities) that lists it becomes active, so one no
persona in the chat uses never starts. One that fails, or doesn't answer within 10 seconds, is skipped with a
warning, and the chat goes on without its tools. `kaja doctor` connects every server and shows each one's
tool count.

## MCP abilities

An MCP ability is the `mcp.toml` of an ability folder, `~/.config/kaja/marketplace/abilities/<name>/mcp.toml`
(the folder name is the ability's name, so the file has none):

```toml
# abilities/context7/mcp.toml
description = "Up-to-date library docs"
transport = "http"                  # http (Streamable HTTP), sse, or stdio
url = "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp"
auth = { type = "apiKey", in = "header", name = "Authorization", prefix = "Bearer ", keyless = true }
tools = ["resolve-library-id", "query-docs"]   # optional: only these reach the model
approval = "never"                  # never | writes | always
```

The marketplace ships `chrome-devtools`, `context7`, `filesystem`, `geo-service`, `sequential-thinking` and `time`.

- A `stdio` ability starts a program on your machine instead of reaching a `url`, and its key goes in an env
  var (`in = "env"`). Most servers are packages, so name the package and Kaja picks a way to run it:

  ```toml
  # abilities/time/mcp.toml
  transport = "stdio"
  package = { pypi = "mcp-server-time@2026.8.18", docker = "mcp/time@sha256:9c46a9…" }
  args = []                           # the server's own arguments, after the package
  ```

  - `npm` packages run on Kaja itself (it has Bun built in, as `bunx`), with Node.js when you have it, so they
    need nothing installed.
  - `pypi` packages run with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)'s `uvx`, else `pipx`.
  - `docker` images run with `docker run`, when nothing else can start the server. Env vars and the key go in
    by name (`-e NAME`), so they never show in the process list.

  Kaja tries them in that order. When none is installed, the ability is left out, and `kaja abilities` and
  `kaja doctor` say what to install. A server that isn't a package takes a `command` (with `args` and `env`)
  instead, and is left out the same way when that command isn't installed. `kaja abilities` shows what each
  one runs on your machine.
- The key lives in `secrets.toml` as `[abilities.<name>] api_key`. Every key is optional: without one the
  ability is simply off, and `kaja doctor` offers to add it. `keyless = true` means the server also works
  without one (like context7, where a key only raises the limits), so the ability stays on; `kaja doctor`
  still offers to add one.
- `approval = "writes"` asks before any tool the server doesn't mark read-only, and `always` asks before
  every call. If a server forgets to mark its read-only tools, list them in `readOnly`, with the arguments
  that turn a call into a write:

  ```toml
  readOnly = [
    "list_pages",                                        # always a read
    { tool = "take_screenshot", unless = ["filePath"] }, # a read, unless it saves a file
  ]
  ```

- A persona can narrow an ability to some of its tools with an entry's `tools` list (see
  [Personas](/abilities/personas#abilities)).
- `roots = true` marks a stdio server that works in folders, like `filesystem`. It gets the active persona's
  folders (its entry's `roots`) as [MCP roots](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/latest/client/roots),
  and new ones when you switch persona, without a restart. It's off for a persona that gives it none, and
  `kaja doctor` says so when no persona does. Run in Docker, every persona's folders are mounted at their own
  paths, and the active persona's roots narrow that down.

  ```toml
  # marketplace/personas/writer.toml (a persona of your own)
  abilities = [{ name = "filesystem", roots = ["~/notes", { path = "~/projects/site", readOnly = true }] }]
  ```

  In a read-only folder the server may only read. The server itself has no such setting, so Kaja refuses
  any call that may write there before it asks you, checking the arguments the manifest names in `pathArgs`
  (symlinks followed). The nearest folder decides, so a writable folder inside a read-only one stays writable.
  While some folder is read-only, those paths must be absolute or `~/…`. A persona whose folders are all
  read-only doesn't get the server's writing tools at all. In Docker, a folder every persona marks read-only
  is also mounted read-only. A manifest without `pathArgs` can't be checked, so its read-only folders are
  left out.

  With `{ path = "~/.config/hypr", backup = true }`, Kaja copies a file there before any call that may change
  it (found through `pathArgs` too) to its own data folder, at `backups/<the file's full path>/<time>`
  (`kaja config paths` shows where), and keeps every copy. If the copy fails, the call doesn't run. As
  with read-only folders, paths must then be absolute or `~/…`. A persona with a backed-up folder also gets
  `list_backups` and `restore_backup`; a restore asks first and backs up the file it replaces, so it can be
  undone too.

- `localOnly = true` keeps a server off the cloud: it only ever runs on your own machine. A `roots` one is
  local-only too.
- `toolDescriptions` says in a line what each listed tool does. The web app shows it, since a server's own
  descriptions only arrive once it runs:

  ```toml
  [toolDescriptions]
  "resolve-library-id" = "Finds a library's Context7 id from its name."
  "query-docs"         = "Fetches current documentation and code examples for a library."
  ```

## In the cloud

Marketplace MCP abilities work in cloud chat and the cloud Telegram bot when they have a `tools` list (so
you can see what a server can do before turning it on, and it can't add tools later), aren't local-only, and
are either remote (`http` or `sse`) or `stdio` without a key.

A `stdio` ability, like `chrome-devtools`, runs in an **MCP sandbox**, never on the API's host. That can be:

- Kaja's own sandbox;
- one you run yourself (`docker run kajaio/sandbox`, with the key from the web app's Sandbox page);
- if you turn on **Use shared sandboxes**, one someone else shares. Whoever runs it can see what runs there.

Each user gets their own copy of the server, started on first use and kept warm between messages (a browser
keeps its open pages) until it's been idle for about 10 minutes. In someone else's sandbox it's stopped as
soon as the turn ends, so nothing (a login, say) stays there. The sandbox's browser can only reach public
websites, not Kaja's servers or anything on the sandbox's private network.

A manifest with `trustedSandbox = true` only runs in your own sandboxes or Kaja's, never in a shared one.
`chrome-devtools` is one, so the browser never runs on someone else's computer.
A `stdio` ability that needs a key stays local for now.

- A turn connects the servers its persona lists (giving up on one after 5 seconds), others after a persona
  switch, and closes them when it ends. Nothing is shared with other users.
- A saved key is tested by connecting and listing the server's tools.
- `approval` and `readOnly` work as above. Images, like screenshots, come back to you, and long results are
  cut at about 32 KB. An argument that would save a file on the server (`localOnlyArgs`, like a screenshot's
  `filePath`) is hidden in the cloud.
- A server that works without a key is shared by everyone on the Kaja server's IP, with its rate limits. Add
  your own key to get yours.

Keys and approvals otherwise work as described in [Abilities in the cloud](/abilities/marketplace#in-the-cloud).
