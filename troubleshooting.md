# Troubleshooting

Start with **`kaja doctor`** (local mode). It tests every key, model, MCP server and tool, asks for what's
missing, and ends with what's still broken. `kaja config paths` shows which files Kaja actually reads.

## Common problems

**The model doesn't answer.** Run `kaja doctor`. It tries every model, and if the one a task uses fails but
another configured for that task works, it offers to switch. For a local server, check it's running at the
`base_url` in [`models.toml`](/configuration/models).

**"No chat model" in local mode.** Local mode needs a model in `models.toml` that lists `chat` in its `tasks`, and never
falls back to cloud. Add one, run `kaja config wizard`, or start with `kaja --cloud`.

**Cloud mode won't sign in: keychain unavailable.** The token is only kept in the OS keychain, with no
plaintext fallback. Use `kaja --local`, or unlock or install a keychain (on Linux, a Secret Service
provider such as GNOME Keyring or KWallet).

**`kaja abilities update` fails.** It needs `git` 2.25 or newer, and `kaja doctor` shows the version it
found. A private or mistyped [`[marketplace]`](/configuration/config#marketplace) `url` fails instead of
asking for a password. Also check that `[marketplace] enabled` isn't `false`.

**An ability doesn't show up.** A chat only gets the abilities its persona lists in `abilities` (see
[Personas](/abilities/personas#abilities)); `kaja abilities` shows which personas use each one. One that needs
a key stays out until the key is in `secrets.toml` (`kaja doctor` asks for it). `kaja doctor` lists everything
left out and why.

**An MCP server's tools are missing.** A server that fails to connect, or takes over 10 seconds, is
skipped so the session can still start. Check its command or URL, and its secrets.

**Alt shortcuts type strange characters (macOS).** Set `hotkeyModifier = "ctrl"` in
[`settings.toml`](/configuration/config#preferences), or turn on "Option as Meta" in your terminal.

**A setting change did nothing.** Config is read once at startup, so restart Kaja. The local Telegram bot
needs a restart too.

## Logs

The terminal UI never logs to the screen. For a log file, set both variables:

```sh
KAJA_LOG_LEVEL=debug KAJA_LOG_FILE=~/kaja.log kaja
```

Levels are `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` and `fatal`. The file is JSON lines and includes the
agent's warnings: skipped abilities, missing keys, failed MCP connections.

## Still stuck?

Open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/kajaio/kaja/issues) with the `kaja doctor` output. Every
config file except `secrets.toml` is safe to include.
