# Database

Kaja has two databases, and they are deliberately not the same size. The **cloud** keeps everything the
platform needs in **PostgreSQL**: accounts, server config, the ability catalog, widgets, Telegram links,
users' secrets, MCP sandboxes, and the agent's own state. The **terminal** in [local mode](/getting-started/modes) keeps only that last
part (one person's conversations, memory and dataset answers) in a single **SQLite** file. Everything
else a local install needs is a file: [`settings.toml`, `models.toml`, `secrets.toml` and the `marketplace/` folder](/configuration/files).

The agent state is the one place the two overlap, and that overlap is a contract: the
[agent brain](/development/nasi) talks to a `NasiStore` interface, and each host injects its own
implementation.

## How the schema is managed

**PostgreSQL** has plain SQL files in `apps/api/migrations/`, applied in lexicographic order:

| File | Creates |
| --- | --- |
| `2026-03-01-uuidv7.sql` | the `uuidv7()` function (via `pgcrypto`) |
| `2026-03-03-better-auth.sql` | `user`, `session`, `account`, `verification`, `device_code` |
| `2026-08-01-config.sql` | `provider`, `model` |
| `2026-08-31-widget.sql` | `widget` |
| `2026-09-07-nasi.sql` | `nasi_session`, `nasi_message`, `nasi_tool_call`, `nasi_session_summary`, `nasi_model_call`, `nasi_note`, `nasi_dataset_answer`, `nasi_dataset_version` |
| `2026-09-10-telegram-link.sql` | `telegram_link`, `telegram_link_token` |
| `2026-09-19-ability.sql` | `ability`, `marketplace_sync` |
| `2026-09-19-user-secret.sql` | `user_secret` |
| `2026-09-27-sandbox.sql` | `sandbox`, `sandbox_owner`, `sandbox_sample` |

Every file only *creates* (`IF NOT EXISTS`). The API's `migrate.ts` runs on every deploy and records each
file it applied, with a checksum, in `schema_migrations`. It applies only files that are new or have changed
since, each in its own transaction, so a failing file leaves nothing half done. Until v1.0 an edited file is
applied again, so files have to stay re-runnable. From v1.0 an edited file stops the deploy, and a change goes
in a new file. The files also run on the first boot of the compose volume; for an existing volume use
`scripts/db_migration.sh`, which runs `migrate.ts` locally.

**Until v1.0 there are no patch migrations.** There is no production data worth keeping, so a schema
change is edited into the file that creates the table, and existing databases are recreated: locally
`docker compose down -v`, in production see [Deployment](/development/deployment#recreating-the-database).

Conventions:

- **Primary keys** are UUIDv7 (time-ordered). Most tables default to `uuidv7()`; the `nasi_*` tables take the
  id from the app, which generates it before the insert.
- **Names** are `snake_case`, Better Auth's tables included: `auth.ts` maps each of its camelCase fields
  (`emailVerified` is `email_verified`, the `deviceCode` table is `device_code`).
- **Types**: `timestamptz` for times, `jsonb` for structured blobs, `text[]` for lists, `boolean` for flags.
- **Enums are `CHECK` constraints**, not Postgres enum types, so adding a value is a one-line change.
- **Everything that belongs to a person cascades** from `user`: deleting the account deletes its sessions,
  notes, keys, widgets and links.
- Row shapes stay private to the API's `services/`; they are mapped to the API types with private helpers.

**SQLite** has no migration files. `createSchema()` in `apps/tui/lib/store/sqlite.ts` runs every time the file
is opened: it creates missing tables, adds the columns older installs lack (`notes.owner`,
`tool_calls.resultSummary`), and drops the earlier session layouts rather than converting them. It opens in WAL mode with foreign keys on.

## PostgreSQL

There are 25 tables in four groups.

### Accounts and access

Better Auth owns the first five tables; the rest hang off `user`. Only the columns that matter here are
shown, see the [migration](https://github.com/kajaio/kaja/blob/main/apps/api/migrations/2026-03-03-better-auth.sql)
for the full list.

```mermaid
erDiagram
  user {
    uuid id PK "UUIDv7"
    text name "may be empty"
    text email UK
    boolean email_verified
    text image
    text role "admin or user"
    boolean banned
    timestamptz created_at
  }

  session {
    uuid id PK
    uuid user_id FK
    text token UK
    timestamptz expires_at
    uuid impersonated_by "admin acting as this user"
  }

  account {
    uuid id PK
    uuid user_id FK
    text provider_id "credential, google"
    text account_id
    text password "hashed, credential accounts"
    text id_token "kept from Google sign-in"
  }

  verification {
    uuid id PK
    text identifier
    text value
    timestamptz expires_at
  }

  device_code {
    uuid id PK
    uuid user_id FK "set once approved"
    text device_code UK
    text user_code UK
    text status
    timestamptz expires_at
  }

  widget {
    uuid id PK
    uuid user_id FK
    text label
    text key_hash UK "the key itself is never stored"
    jsonb config
    text_array allowed_origins
    boolean enabled
  }

  telegram_link {
    bigint telegram_user_id PK
    uuid user_id FK
    timestamptz linked_at
  }

  telegram_link_token {
    text token_hash PK
    uuid user_id FK
    timestamptz expires_at
  }

  user_secret {
    uuid user_id PK
    text name PK "ability:name"
    bytea ciphertext "AES-256-GCM"
    bytea iv
    bytea tag
  }

  user ||--o{ session : has
  user ||--o{ account : "signs in with"
  user |o--o{ device_code : approves
  user ||--o{ widget : owns
  user ||--o{ telegram_link : connects
  user ||--o{ telegram_link_token : "starts a link with"
  user ||--o{ user_secret : stores
```

`verification` stands alone: Better Auth uses it for email and password-reset tokens and looks rows up by
`identifier`. `device_code` is the CLI's device login: the terminal polls it until a signed-in user approves
the code on the web.

`user_secret` holds the API keys people save for abilities. The value never leaves the server: it is
encrypted with `USER_SECRET_KEY`, and the user id and `name` are bound in as associated data, so a row
copied to another user or name fails to decrypt.

### Server config and abilities

The first two tables are what an admin manages at `/admin`; there is no user id, because they configure the
whole deployment. The ability tables are the cloud's copy of the marketplace.

```mermaid
erDiagram
  provider {
    uuid id PK
    text name UK
    text base_url
    text api_key
  }

  model {
    uuid id PK
    uuid provider_id FK
    text model
    text_array tasks "chat, tts, stt, embedding, rerank, summarize..."
    boolean enabled
    boolean free
    integer context_window "null = ask the provider"
  }

  ability {
    uuid id PK
    text type "skill, persona, tool, mcp, dataset"
    text name "unique with type"
    text description
    jsonb files "path to text content"
    boolean has_scripts
    text content_hash
    text commit
    timestamptz removed_at "set when it leaves the marketplace"
  }

  marketplace_sync {
    integer id PK "always 1"
    text commit "last synced commit"
    timestamptz synced_at
    text error
  }

  user {
    uuid id PK
  }

  provider ||--o{ model : offers
```

- `ability` rows come from the marketplace repos (`MARKETPLACE_SOURCES`), synced hourly and on demand (see
  [Marketplace internals](/development/marketplace)). A sync never deletes: an ability that leaves gets `removed_at`, and comes back if it returns.
- Every user has every available ability; each persona's `abilities` list picks what a turn uses, so there's
  no per-user switch. `marketplace_sync` is a single row holding each source's commit, so an unchanged set of sources skips the download.
- Personas and datasets are `ability` rows too (type `persona` and `dataset`), synced like skills; datasets
  come with the personas that use them. There is no separate persona table.

### MCP sandboxes

The cloud's registry of [MCP sandboxes](https://github.com/kajaio/kaja/tree/main/apps/sandbox#readme), the
machines that run stdio MCP servers for cloud turns. Anyone can run one. Each dials the API's WebSocket and
registers itself here.

```mermaid
erDiagram
  sandbox {
    uuid id PK
    uuid user_id FK "null = anonymous"
    boolean official "the operator's own box"
    text secret_hash "lets it come back as this row"
    text name
    boolean online
    inet ip
    text country_code "picked out of the geo answer"
    jsonb info "version, arch, cpu, memory, abilities"
    jsonb load "running, load, memoryUsed"
    timestamptz last_seen_at
  }

  sandbox_owner {
    uuid user_id PK
    text key_hash UK "shown once when made"
    boolean share "others may use my sandboxes"
    boolean use_shared "my turns may run in shared ones"
  }

  sandbox_sample {
    uuid sandbox_id PK
    timestamptz at PK
    integer running
    real load
    bigint memory_used
  }

  user ||--o{ sandbox : runs
  user ||--o| sandbox_owner : "has settings"
  sandbox ||--o{ sandbox_sample : reports
```

- A sandbox with no `user_id` and `official = false` is anonymous and open to everyone. `official` marks the
  operator's own box, set by `SANDBOX_SYSTEM_KEY`.
- `sandbox_owner` holds a user's sandbox key (only its hash) and the two sharing switches.
- `sandbox_sample` gets one heartbeat a minute per sandbox, for the admin load chart. An hourly job deletes
  samples older than 7 days, and anonymous sandboxes a week after they were last online.

### The cloud agent's state

This is the group that mirrors the SQLite file. Everything hangs off one `user`, so a person's cloud terminal chats,
Telegram bot and widget visitors are all partitioned by `user_id`, and by `owner` within it.

```mermaid
erDiagram
  nasi_session {
    uuid id PK
    uuid user_id FK
    text persona
    text model
    text title
    text owner "null = web app, else telegram or widget id"
    text channel "web, telegram or widget"
    text system_prompt
    text pending_call_id "a call waiting on the human"
    text pending_kind
    text_array granted_tools "tools approved for the rest of the session"
    timestamptz created_at
    timestamptz updated_at
  }

  nasi_message {
    uuid id PK
    uuid session_id FK
    integer seq "unique per session"
    text role
    text content
    jsonb parts "image parts"
    text reasoning
    text tool_call_id "on tool results"
    text model "assistant rows: one model round"
    integer prompt_tokens
    integer completion_tokens
    integer latency_ms
    text finish_reason
  }

  nasi_tool_call {
    uuid id PK
    uuid message_id FK
    integer position "unique per message"
    text call_id "the provider's id"
    text name
    text arguments
    uuid result_message_id FK
    text status "ok, error, declined or skipped"
    integer duration_ms
    text approval "approved or declined"
    text result_summary "what the model gets instead of an oversized result"
  }

  nasi_session_summary {
    uuid session_id PK
    integer summary_from PK "seq of the first message it doesn't cover"
    text summary
    timestamptz created_at
  }

  nasi_model_call {
    uuid id PK
    uuid session_id FK
    text kind "compact, condense or summarize"
    text model
    integer prompt_tokens
    integer completion_tokens
    integer latency_ms
    timestamptz created_at
  }

  nasi_note {
    uuid user_id PK
    text owner PK "empty string = web app and CLI"
    text key PK
    text content
    text importance "low, medium or high"
    jsonb tags
    boolean sticky
    text created_at
    text last_used_at
    integer use_count
  }

  nasi_dataset_answer {
    uuid user_id PK
    text topic PK
    text owner PK "empty string = no owner"
    integer version PK
    text field PK
    text value
    text answered_at
  }

  nasi_dataset_version {
    uuid user_id PK
    text topic PK
    text owner PK
    integer version PK
    text completed_at
  }

  user {
    uuid id PK
  }

  user ||--o{ nasi_session : has
  user ||--o{ nasi_note : remembers
  user ||--o{ nasi_dataset_answer : answers
  user ||--o{ nasi_dataset_version : completes
  nasi_session ||--o{ nasi_message : has
  nasi_session ||--o{ nasi_session_summary : "compacted into"
  nasi_session ||--o{ nasi_model_call : "summarised with"
  nasi_message ||--o{ nasi_tool_call : makes
  nasi_tool_call }o--o| nasi_message : "result is"
  nasi_dataset_answer }o..o| nasi_dataset_version : "topic, owner, version"
```

A session is **rows**, not a blob: one row per message and one per tool call. The assistant's messages
double as its steps, carrying the model, token counts, latency and finish reason of that round, which is
what the usage stats on the dashboard are computed from. Deleting a message never leaves a dangling result:
`result_message_id` is set to null instead.

The message log is append-only and never shortened. When a long conversation is
[compacted](/configuration/config#context), a `nasi_session_summary` row is added and the model is sent the
latest summary in place of the messages before `summary_from`; every earlier summary stays. A tool result too
big for the context keeps its full output in its message, and the condensed version the model gets goes in
`nasi_tool_call.result_summary`. Each request that wrote a summary (compacting, condensing, or the
`summarize` tool) is a `nasi_model_call` row, so the stats count its tokens too.

An image a message carries (a screenshot a tool returned, say) is not in the database: it goes to object
storage once per session, under `images/<userId>/<sessionId>/<hash>`, and the message's `parts` refer to it
as `kaja-image:<hash>`; loading the session puts the image back in place, and deleting it removes the images.

Datasets have no foreign key between answers and versions: answers are written field by field as the user
replies, and the `nasi_dataset_version` row appears only when the topic is complete.

## SQLite

The local file is the second half of the agent state, documented table by table on
[Local storage](/configuration/storage). It has nine tables: `notes`, `sessions`, `messages`, `tool_calls`,
`session_summaries`, `model_calls`, `session_events`, `dataset_answers` and
`dataset_versions`.

## Side by side

### Table mapping

| Concept | PostgreSQL | SQLite |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Conversation | `nasi_session` | `sessions` |
| Message (and step) | `nasi_message` | `messages` |
| Tool call | `nasi_tool_call` | `tool_calls` |
| Compaction summary | `nasi_session_summary` | `session_summaries` |
| Summarizer call | `nasi_model_call` | `model_calls` |
| Message image | object storage, `images/<userId>/<sessionId>/` | files beside the SQLite file, `files/images/<sessionId>/` |
| Memory note | `nasi_note` | `notes` |
| Dataset answer | `nasi_dataset_answer` | `dataset_answers` |
| Completed dataset | `nasi_dataset_version` | `dataset_versions` |
| What the terminal screen showed | not stored | `session_events` |
| Accounts, sessions, device login | Better Auth tables | none (the token lives in the OS keychain) |
| Providers and models | `provider`, `model` | `models.toml` |
| MCP servers | `ability` rows of type `mcp` | the marketplace folder (an ability's `mcp.toml`) |
| Abilities | `ability`, `marketplace_sync`, picked by the personas | the `marketplace/` folder, picked by its personas |
| API keys | `user_secret` (encrypted) | `secrets.toml` |
| Widgets, Telegram links | `widget`, `telegram_link*` | none (local mode has no widgets; the bot's token is in `secrets.toml`) |

### How they differ

| | PostgreSQL | SQLite |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Whose data** | many accounts; every row belongs to a `user_id` with `ON DELETE CASCADE` | one person; no user table, so `owner` is the only namespace |
| **Where** | a server, over a connection pool | one file, `memory.sqlite`, in the XDG data directory (overridable with `[memory] dbPath`) |
| **Concurrency** | MVCC; many API requests at once | WAL mode with a 5 s `busy_timeout`, so the terminal and the Telegram bot can share the file |
| **Ids** | `uuid`, app-generated UUIDv7 for `nasi_*` | `TEXT`, app-generated UUIDv7 |
| **Times** | `timestamptz`, always UTC instants | ISO-8601 `TEXT` in UTC (`…Z`) |
| **Structured data** | `jsonb`, `text[]` | JSON in `TEXT` |
| **Booleans** | `boolean` | `INTEGER` 0/1 |
| **Column names** | `snake_case` | `camelCase` |
| **Foreign keys** | always enforced | enforced only because `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` is set on each connection |
| **Schema changes** | SQL migration files, re-run on every deploy | `createSchema()` on every open; a missing column is added in place, older layouts are dropped, not converted |
| **Deleting your data** | delete the account and the cascade does it | delete the file and the `files/` folder beside it |

### Differences that change behaviour

- **`session_events` is SQLite-only.** The terminal stores its rendered timeline so a resumed session looks
  the way it did. The cloud keeps no timeline: `NasiStore` passes `events` in, and the Postgres store ignores
  it and returns an empty list.
- **`channel` and stricter checks are Postgres-only.** `nasi_session.channel` (`web`, `telegram`, `widget`) is
  derived from the owner's prefix when the row is written, and `pending_kind` has a `CHECK`. SQLite stores
  `pendingKind` as free `TEXT`. Both back ends check `importance`, tool-call `status` and `approval`.
- **Notes and datasets partition the same way.** Both back ends key them by `owner`, with the empty string for
  "no owner" (so it can sit in a primary key): the web app, a Telegram user and each widget visitor keep their
  own notes and answers. The cloud adds `user_id` in front. A save replaces only that owner's set.
